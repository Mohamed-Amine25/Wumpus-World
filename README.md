The wumpus world.pl contains the prolog code that we developped with my teammate Youssef Gaimes.
The screenshots file containes some initial configurations and the result that we got after running them.
To try a certain game you can change the init predicate i the code with the init of the desired game that you will find in the intial configurations.txt
to run the game enter in the command line:
?- start.
